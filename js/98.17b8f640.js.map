Traders can effectively leverage these LLMs to analyze financial news and predict stock returns accurately. However, integrating LLMs into existing quantitative models presents two primary challenges: the insufficient utilization of semantic information embedded within LLMs and the difficulties in aligning the latent information within LLMs with pre-existing quantitative stock features. We propose a novel framework consisting of two components to surmount these challenges. The first component, the Local Global model, approaches understanding stock features and financial news (through LLMs) as a unified problem. The second component, Self-Correlated Reinforcement Learning, focuses on aligning the embeddings of financial news generated by LLMs with stock features within the same semantic space. By implementing our framework, we have demonstrated superior performance in Rank Information Coefficient and returns, particularly compared to models relying only on stock features in the China A-share market. \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"cente-title\"},[_vm._v(\" Oral Presentation 6: Chinese Fine-Grained Financial Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models \")]),_vm._v(\" Abstract: Entity-level fine-grained sentiment analysis in the financial domain is a crucial subtask of sentiment analysis and currently faces numerous challenges.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks, primarily centered around language pattern matching. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensive Chinese fine-grained financial sentiment analysis dataset, FinChina SA, for enterprise early warning. We thoroughly evaluate and experiment with well-known existing open-source LLMs using our dataset.

However, those models do not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement estimation). In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance. \"),_c('div',{staticClass:\"cente-title\"},[_vm._v(\" Can ChatGPT Overcome Behavioral Biases in the Financial Sector?

In behavioral finance, this effect must be carefully managed to prevent undesirable outcomes in the investment process. In the application of large language models, prompt engineering is often employed to mitigate the framing effect. While previous research in this domain has focused on sentiment classification or subject recognition, this study employs a large language model to score gold-related news and designs the ”Classify-and-Rethink” prompt strategy from the perspective of behavioral finance. Our experiment demonstrates that the Classify-and-Rethink prompt approach effectively overcomes the framing effect and facilitates excess returns. Compared to alternative prompt designs, the Classify-and-Rethink strategy exhibits higher yields and Sharpe ratios.

However, all methods mentioned above only exploit historical data to predict stock price movement in the next trading day. Apart from stock historical data, data in text modality like finance-related news or social platform contents can also reflect the moving trend of stocks. Instead of training a new model to learn the representation of text data, we use large language models (LLMs) to directly predict the price movement of stocks. Considering the possible lack of domain data in training corpora of LLMs, we introduce in-context learning to explore if LLMs can learn necessary knowledge from given prediction examples consisting of both historical data and text data. In this paper, we focus on overnight stock price movement prediction. Our experiment results show that LLMs can boost performance in this task compared to competitive baselines and in-context learning can be beneficial for prediction in some cases.

This pipeline yielded a robust instruction tuning dataset comprised of 103k\r\n        multi-turn chats. Extensive experiments have been conducted on this dataset to evaluate the model’s performance\r\n        by adopting an external GPT-4 as the judge. The promising experimental results verify that our approach led to\r\n        significant advancements in generating accurate, relevant, and financial-style responses from AI models, and\r\n        thus providing a powerful tool for applications within the financial sector.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Oral Presentation 5: Integrating Stock Features and Global Information via Large Language Models for Enhanced\r\n          Stock Return Prediction\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: The remarkable achievements and rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and\r\n        GPT-4 have showcased their immense potential in quantitative investment. Traders can effectively leverage these\r\n        LLMs to analyze financial news and predict stock returns accurately. However, integrating LLMs into existing\r\n        quantitative models presents two primary challenges: the insufficient utilization of semantic information\r\n        embedded within LLMs and the difficulties in aligning the latent information within LLMs with pre-existing\r\n        quantitative stock features. We propose a novel framework consisting of two components to surmount these\r\n        challenges. The first component, the Local Global model, approaches understanding stock features and financial\r\n        news (through LLMs) as a unified problem. The second component, Self-Correlated Reinforcement Learning, focuses\r\n        on aligning the embeddings of financial news generated by LLMs with stock features within the same semantic\r\n        space. By implementing our framework, we have demonstrated superior performance in Rank Information Coefficient\r\n        and returns, particularly compared to models relying only on stock features in the China A-share market.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Oral Presentation 6: Chinese Fine-Grained Financial Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: Entity-level fine-grained sentiment analysis in the financial domain is a crucial subtask of sentiment\r\n        analysis and currently faces numerous challenges. The primary challenge stems from the lack of high-quality and\r\n        large-scale annotated corpora specifically designed for financial text sentiment analysis, which in turn limits\r\n        the availability of data necessary for developing effective text processing techniques. Recent advancements in\r\n        large language models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks, primarily\r\n        centered around language pattern matching. In this paper, we propose a novel and extensive Chinese fine-grained\r\n        financial sentiment analysis dataset, FinChina SA, for enterprise early warning. We thoroughly evaluate and\r\n        experiment with well-known existing open-source LLMs using our dataset. We firmly believe that our dataset will\r\n        serve as a valuable resource to advance the exploration of real-world financial sentiment analysis tasks, which\r\n        should be the focus of future research.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Oral Presentation 7: NumGPT: Improving Numeracy Ability of Generative Pre-trained Models\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: Existing generative pre-trained language models (e.g., GPT) focus on modeling the language structure\r\n        and semantics of general texts. However, those models do not consider the numerical properties of numbers and\r\n        cannot perform robustly on numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement estimation). In\r\n        this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of\r\n        numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the\r\n        number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeral-aware loss function is\r\n        designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on\r\n        four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT\r\n        outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as\r\n        measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification. Ablation studies\r\n        are also conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Can ChatGPT Overcome Behavioral Biases in the Financial Sector? Classify-and-Rethink: Multi-Step Zero-Shot\r\n          Reasoning in the Gold Investment\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: The framing effect is a phenomenon observed in both humans and large language models where different\r\n        descriptions of the same objectively identical problem can lead to different decisions. In behavioral finance,\r\n        this effect must be carefully managed to prevent undesirable outcomes in the investment process. In the\r\n        application of large language models, prompt engineering is often employed to mitigate the framing effect. While\r\n        previous research in this domain has focused on sentiment classification or subject recognition, this study\r\n        employs a large language model to score gold-related news and designs the ”Classify-and-Rethink” prompt strategy\r\n        from the perspective of behavioral finance. Our experiment demonstrates that the Classify-and-Rethink prompt\r\n        approach effectively overcomes the framing effect and facilitates excess returns. Compared to alternative prompt\r\n        designs, the Classify-and-Rethink strategy exhibits higher yields and Sharpe ratios. This framework provides a\r\n        valuable basis for future research on behavioral finance in large-scale analysis of financial texts and offers\r\n        investors a reliable means of mitigating behavioral biases.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Oral Presentation 9: XuanYuan: A Large Chinese Financial Chat Model with Hundreds of Billions Parameters\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: In recent years, pre-trained language models have undergone rapid development with the emergence of\r\n        large-scale models. However, there is a lack of open-sourced chat models specifically designed for the Chinese\r\n        language, especially in the field of Chinese finance, at the scale of hundreds of billions. To address this gap,\r\n        we introduce XuanYuan 2.0 (轩辕 2.0), the largest Chinese chat model to date, built upon the BLOOM-176B\r\n        architecture. To enable the model to generate a larger quantity of correct and financial instruction data, we\r\n        introduce an innovative framework named SELF-QA, which replaces the traditional practice of human-written\r\n        instruction seeds with a vast amount of unsupervised knowledge. Additionally, we propose a novel training method\r\n        called Hybrid-tuning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. By combining general-domain with domain-specific\r\n        knowledge and integrating the stages of pre-training and fine-tuning, XuanYuan 2.0 is capable of providing\r\n        accurate and contextually appropriate responses in the Chinese financial domain. Our model has been made public\r\n        on Github and Huggingface, and has received widespread attention.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">SPAM-T5: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Few-Shot Email Spam Detection</div>\r\n        Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in email spam detection by\r\n        comparing prominent models from three distinct families: BERT-like, Sentence Transformers, and Seq2Seq.\r\n        Additionally, we examine well-established machine learning techniques for spam detection, such as Naïve Bayes\r\n        and LightGBM, as baseline methods. We assess the performance of these models across four public datasets,\r\n        utilizing different numbers of training samples (full training set and few-shot settings). Our findings reveal\r\n        that, in the majority of cases, LLMs surpass the performance of the popular baseline techniques, particularly in\r\n        few-shot scenarios. This adaptability renders LLMs uniquely suited to spam detection tasks, where labeled\r\n        samples are limited in number and models require frequent updates. Additionally, we introduce SPAM-T5, a Flan-T5\r\n        model that has been specifically adapted and fine-tuned for the purpose of detecting email spam. Our results\r\n        demonstrate that SPAM-T5 surpasses baseline models and other LLMs in the majority of scenarios, particularly\r\n        when there are a limited number of training samples available. Our code is publicly available at\r\n        https://github.com/jpmorganchase/llm-email-spam-detection.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Exploring In-Context Learning for Overnight Stock Price Movement Prediction with Large Language Models\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: Stock price movement prediction is an important task in the financial domain since accurate price\r\n        prediction for the next trading day brings great benefits for making decisions on stock transactions. Except for\r\n        some common indicators like 20-days moving average, time-series regression models including linear regression,\r\n        RNN-based models, and Transformer achieve satisfying performance in this task and are widely applied. However,\r\n        all methods mentioned above only exploit historical data to predict stock price movement in the next trading\r\n        day. Apart from stock historical data, data in text modality like finance-related news or social platform\r\n        contents can also reflect the moving trend of stocks. Instead of training a new model to learn the\r\n        representation of text data, we use large language models (LLMs) to directly predict the price movement of\r\n        stocks. Considering the possible lack of domain data in training corpora of LLMs, we introduce in-context\r\n        learning to explore if LLMs can learn necessary knowledge from given prediction examples consisting of both\r\n        historical data and text data. In this paper, we focus on overnight stock price movement prediction. Our\r\n        experiment results show that LLMs can boost performance in this task compared to competitive baselines and\r\n        in-context learning can be beneficial for prediction in some cases. Our further analyses explore the influence\r\n        of data modalities, sample selection strategies, and the number of examples on models’ performance.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">The Challenges of LLMs in Financial Services</div>\r\n        Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs), the financial services sector has shown\r\n        outstanding advantages and potential. At the same time, risks and challenges for financial services are brought\r\n        into traditional businesses, such as data privacy, ethics, misinformation, disinformation, and social\r\n        injustices. In light of those challenges, this paper reports on a mixed-methods study with corporate middle\r\n        management, high management, and technical staff. Our preliminary findings suggest that financial services\r\n        practitioners are optimistic about the future of LLMs but distrustful of existing ones. Our paper should be read\r\n        as a preliminary study rather than a complete research work. Thus our suggestions on improving LLMs for specific\r\n        domains, such as financial services, are, hopefully, useful to those who share similar interests in improving\r\n        LLMs for realistic use.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          Unveiling the Potential of Sentiment: Can Large Language Models Predict Chinese Stock Price Movements?\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to extensive discourse regarding their\r\n        potential to boost the return of quantitative stock trading strategies. This discourse primarily revolves around\r\n        harnessing the remarkable comprehension capabilities of LLMs to extract sentiment factors which facilitate\r\n        informed and high-frequency investment portfolio adjustments. To ensure successful implementations of these LLMs\r\n        into the analysis of Chinese financial texts and the subsequent trading strategy development within the Chinese\r\n        stock market, we provide a rigorous and encompassing benchmark as well as a standardized back-testing framework\r\n        aiming at objectively assessing the efficacy of various types of LLMs in the specialized domain of sentiment\r\n        factor extraction from Chinese news text data. To illustrate how our benchmark works, we reference three\r\n        distinctive models: 1) the generative LLM (ChatGPT), 2) the Chinese language-specific pre-trained LLM\r\n        (Erlangshen-RoBERTa), and 3) the financial domain-specific fine-tuned LLM classifier(Chinese FinBERT). We apply\r\n        them directly to the task of sentiment factor extraction from large volumes of Chinese news summary texts. We\r\n        then proceed to building quantitative trading strategies and running back-tests under realistic trading\r\n        scenarios based on the derived sentiment factors and evaluate their performances with our benchmark. By\r\n        constructing such a comparative analysis, we invoke the question of what constitutes the most important element\r\n        for improving a LLM’s performance on extracting sentiment factors. And by ensuring that the LLMs are evaluated\r\n        on the same benchmark, following the same standardized experimental procedures that are designed with sufficient\r\n        expertise in quantitative trading, we make the first stride toward answering such a question.\r\n\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">FinVis-GPT: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Financial Chart Analysis</div>\r\n        Abstract: In this paper, we propose FinVis-GPT, a novel multimodal large language model (LLM) specifically\r\n        designed for financial chart analysis. By leveraging the power of LLMs and incorporating instruction tuning and\r\n        multimodal capabilities, FinVis-GPT is capable of interpreting financial charts and providing valuable analysis.\r\n        To train FinVis-GPT, a financial task oriented dataset was generated for pretraining alignment and instruction\r\n        tuning, comprising various types of financial charts and their corresponding descriptions. We evaluate the model\r\n        performance via several case studies due to the time limit, and the promising results demonstrated that\r\n        FinVis-GPT is superior in various financial chart related tasks, including generating descriptions, answering\r\n        questions and predicting future market trends, surpassing existing state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs. The\r\n        proposed FinVis-GPT serves as a pioneering effort in utilizing multimodal LLMs in the finance domain and our\r\n        generated dataset will be release for public use in the near future to speedup related research.\r\n        <div class=\"cente-title\">\r\n          CGCE: A Chinese Generative Chat Evaluation Benchmark for General and Financial Domains\r\n        </div>\r\n        Abstract: Generative chat models, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, have revolutionized natural language generation\r\n        (NLG) by incorporating instructions and human feedback to achieve significant performance improvements. However,\r\n        the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks for chat models, particularly for Chinese and domain-specific\r\n        models, hinders their assessment and progress. To address this gap, we introduce the Chinese Generative Chat\r\n        Evaluation (CGCE) benchmark, focusing on general and financial domains. The CGCE benchmark encompasses diverse\r\n        tasks, including 300 questions in the general domain and 150 specific professional questions in the financial\r\n        domain. Manual scoring evaluates factors such as accuracy, coherence, expression clarity, and completeness. To\r\n        the best of our knowledge, the financial evaluation section of CGCE is the first evaluation benchmark for\r\n        large-scale chat models in the Chinese financial domain. The CGCE benchmark provides researchers with a\r\n        standardized framework to assess and compare Chinese generative chat models, fostering advancements in NLG\r\n        research.\r\n      </div>\r\n      <h1 class=\"big-title\">Award</h1>\r\n      <div class=\"jz-box\">\r\n        <img\r\n          v-for=\"item in 6\"\r\n          :key=\"item\"\r\n          :src=\"require(`../../assets/img/jiangzhuang (${item}).jpg`)\"\r\n          alt=\"\"\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\nexport default {}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style lang=\"less\" scoped>\r\n@import '../../style/global.less';\r\n.padding {\r\n  padding: 0 130px;\r\n}\r\n.title {\r\n  font-size: 40px;\r\n  color: #0d152e;\r\n  font-weight: 600;\r\n  margin-top: 59px;\r\n  @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n    font-size: 60px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.big-title {\r\n  @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n    font-size: 60px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.cente-text {\r\n  font-size: 20px;\r\n  color: #81838c;\r\n  text-align: justify;\r\n  line-height: 1.5;\r\n\r\n  @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n    font-size: 40px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .cente-title {\r\n    font-size: 26px;\r\n    color: #81838c;\r\n    margin-top: 68px;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n\r\n    @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n      font-size: 52px;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  .mg {\r\n    margin-top: 25px !important;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.centen-box {\r\n  margin-top: 50px;\r\n  h1 {\r\n    font-size: 32px;\r\n    color: #0d152e;\r\n    line-height: 2;\r\n    font-weight: 600;\r\n    display: flex;\r\n    align-items: center;\r\n    @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n      font-size: 50px;\r\n    }\r\n    &::before {\r\n      content: '';\r\n      display: inline-block;\r\n      width: 10px;\r\n      height: 35px;\r\n      background-color: #4774f4;\r\n      margin-right: 10px;\r\n      vertical-align: baseline;\r\n      @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n        height: 50px;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  .text {\r\n    font-size: 20px;\r\n    color: #81838c;\r\n    text-align: justify;\r\n    line-height: 1.5;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    margin-bottom: 30px;\r\n    @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n      font-size: 40px;\r\n    }\r\n    .email {\r\n      color: #0088ff;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  .link {\r\n    display: block;\r\n    font-size: 20px;\r\n    color: #0088ff;\r\n    line-height: 2;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    margin-bottom: 20px;\r\n    @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n      font-size: 40px;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  .process {\r\n    font-size: 20px;\r\n    color: #81838c;\r\n    line-height: 2;\r\n    font-weight: 400;\r\n    @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n      font-size: 40px;\r\n    }\r\n    span {\r\n      color: #1eb9e1;\r\n    }\r\n    .process-img {\r\n      display: flex;\r\n      margin-bottom: 28px;\r\n      @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n        justify-content: space-between;\r\n      }\r\n      & > div {\r\n        width: 200px;\r\n        margin-right: 30px;\r\n        @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n          width: 48%;\r\n          margin: 0;\r\n        }\r\n        img {\r\n          width: 100%;\r\n          height: 100%;\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.cente-text {\r\n  font-size: 20px;\r\n  color: #81838c;\r\n  text-align: justify;\r\n  line-height: 1.5;\r\n\r\n  @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n    font-size: 40px;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  .cente-title {\r\n    font-size: 26px;\r\n    color: #81838c;\r\n    margin-top: 68px;\r\n    font-weight: 500;\r\n    text-align: left;\r\n\r\n    @media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n      font-size: 52px;\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n.mg-bottom {\r\n  margin-bottom: 50px;\r\n}\r\n@media (max-width: 750px) {\r\n  .header,\r\n  .footer {\r\n    min-width: 375px;\r\n  }\r\n  .header {\r\n    height: 200px;\r\n    line-height: 200px;\r\n    font-size: 80px;\r\n  }\r\n  .w {\r\n    min-width: 100vw;\r\n    max-width: 100vw;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n.jz-box {\r\n  display: flex;\r\n  justify-content: space-between;\r\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\r\n  img {\r\n    width: 48%;\r\n    margin-bottom: 50px;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/.pnpm/registry.npmmirror.com+thread-loader@3.0.4_webpack@5.88.2/node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/.pnpm/registry.npmmirror.com+babel-loader@8.3.0_@babel+core@7.12.16_webpack@5.88.2/node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js??clonedRuleSet-40.use[1]!../../../node_modules/.pnpm/registry.npmmirror.com+vue-loader@15.10.1_babel-core@6.26.3_css-loader@6.8.1_vue-template-compiler@2.6.14_webpack@5.88.2/node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./index.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
