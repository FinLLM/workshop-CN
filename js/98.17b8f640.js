Expanding the application of these models and technologies to specialized fields, specifically the financial industry, has become an intriguing research topic, given its potential for immense value and impact. However, it is apparent that the financial industry presents a unique set of challenges for general large language models, due to its inherently complex and dynamic nature. In this survey, we will review the existing academic work on large language models in the financial domain, and summarize the unique and specific features of the financial field compared to general domains. In addition, we will examine several key peculiarities and discuss relevant research works in the field of large language models.

However, the finance domain presents unique challenges, including high temporal sensitivity, constant dynamism, and a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While proprietary models like BloombergGPT have taken advantage of their unique data accumulation, such privileged access calls for an open-source alternative to democratize internet-scale financial data. In this paper, we present an open-source large language model, FinGPT, for the finance sector. Unlike proprietary models, FinGPT takes a data-centric approach, providing researchers and practitioners with accessible and transparent resources to customize their financial LLMs (FinLLMs). We highlight the importance of an automatic data curation pipeline and the lightweight low-rank adaptation technique in building FinGPT. Furthermore, we will showcase potential applications as stepping stones for users, such as robo-advising and sentiment analysis. Through collaborative efforts within the opensource AI4Finance community, FinGPT aims to stimulate innovation, democratize FinLLMs, and unlock new opportunities in open finance.

In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective instruction tuning approach to address these issues. By transforming a small portion of supervised financial sentiment analysis data into instruction data and finetuning a general-purpose LLM with this method, we achieve remarkable advancements in financial sentiment analysis.

Traders can effectively leverage these LLMs to analyze financial news and predict stock returns accurately. However, integrating LLMs into existing quantitative models presents two primary challenges: the insufficient utilization of semantic information embedded within LLMs and the difficulties in aligning the latent information within LLMs with pre-existing quantitative stock features. We propose a novel framework consisting of two components to surmount these challenges. The first component, the Local Global model, approaches understanding stock features and financial news (through LLMs) as a unified problem. The second component, Self-Correlated Reinforcement Learning, focuses on aligning the embeddings of financial news generated by LLMs with stock features within the same semantic space. By implementing our framework, we have demonstrated superior performance in Rank Information Coefficient and returns, particularly compared to models relying only on stock features in the China A-share market.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have yielded remarkable performance in natural language processing tasks, primarily centered around language pattern matching.

However, those models do not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement estimation). In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance.

While previous research in this domain has focused on sentiment classification or subject recognition, this study employs a large language model to score gold-related news and designs the ”Classify-and-Rethink” prompt strategy from the perspective of behavioral finance. Our experiment demonstrates that the Classify-and-Rethink prompt approach effectively overcomes the framing effect and facilitates excess returns. Compared to alternative prompt designs, the Classify-and-Rethink strategy exhibits higher yields and Sharpe ratios.

We assess the performance of these models across four public datasets, utilizing different numbers of training samples (full training set and few-shot settings). Our findings reveal that, in the majority of cases, LLMs surpass the performance of the popular baseline techniques, particularly in few-shot scenarios.

Except for some common indicators like 20-days moving average, time-series regression models including linear regression, RNN-based models, and Transformer achieve satisfying performance in this task and are widely applied. However, all methods mentioned above only exploit historical data to predict stock price movement in the next trading day. Apart from stock historical data, data in text modality like finance-related news or social platform contents can also reflect the moving trend of stocks. Instead of training a new model to learn the representation of text data, we use large language models (LLMs) to directly predict the price movement of stocks. Considering the possible lack of domain data in training corpora of LLMs, we introduce in-context learning to explore if LLMs can learn necessary knowledge from given prediction examples consisting of both historical data and text data. In this paper, we focus on overnight stock price movement prediction. Our experiment results show that LLMs can boost performance in this task compared to competitive baselines and in-context learning can be beneficial for prediction in some cases. Our further analyses explore the influence of data modalities, sample selection strategies, and the number of examples on models’ performance.
