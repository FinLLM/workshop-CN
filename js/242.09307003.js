However, those models do not consider the numerical properties of numbers and cannot perform robustly on numerical reasoning tasks (e.g., math word problems and measurement estimation). In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeralaware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification. Ablation studies are also conducted to evaluate the impact of pre-training and model hyperparameters on the performance. "),n("div",{staticClass:"cente-title"},[e._v("#2.

Instead of training a new model to learn the representation of text data, we use large language models (LLMs) to directly predict the price movement of stocks. Considering the possible lack of domain data in training corpora of LLMs, we introduce in-context learning to explore if LLMs can learn necessary knowledge from given prediction examples consisting of both historical data and text data.
